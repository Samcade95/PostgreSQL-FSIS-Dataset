Within the project, I examined a large quantitative dataset from the FSIS (Food Safety and Inspection Service), and imported the dataset to a table I created within pgAdmin4 uisng PostgreSQL.
Throughout the project, I removed missing values from the dataset, inaccurate zip codes, spelling errors, and removed null values as well within the columns using constraints.
I restored and updated original values and restored missing column values, and when column values were missing I updated the rows attached to them. 
I updated values across multiple tables by creating a backup table of the original table that reflected the large FSIS dataset.
Finally I deleted unnecessary rows, columns, and tables from the relational database.
